# Webflyx

Webflyx is a virtual content service used in the Learn Git course on Boot.Dev taught by the Primeagen. The contents of this repo were created in order to learn the fundamentals of Git:
- the branch system
- creating, switching and merging branches
- porcelain and plumbing commands
- fetching
- push and pull requests
- creating .gitignore
- the important differences between rebasing and remerging
- difference between Git and GitHub
- setting up your GitHub repo aka this project

Through this course, I believe I have developed a solid understanding of the basics of working with Git repos and contributing to projects.
